Between the <<<<<<< and =======, you will find the version as per the changes in your current branch, relative to the base commit.

Between the ======= and >>>>>>>, you will find the version according to the other branch, relative to the base commit.

For convenience, after the <<<<<<< and >>>>>>> markers, you will see hints as to which commit that part of the conflict stems from, HEAD of course being the current revision.

To resolve the conflicts, you have to decide what the end result should be. This is not something you can do without thinking, otherwise Git would have done it for you.
